## Projects :books:
- Jump to the [Projects tab](https://davejacobson12.github.io/projects/) for analyses, workflows, and reports. 
  - Note the reports are facsimiles using dummy data instead of real outbreak clusters and IDs.

## Code Availability :floppy_disk:
- My [GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/davejacobson12/Portfolio) hosts code used for the  Projects tab.
- The [Repositories tab](https://davejacobson12.github.io/repositories/) has links to GitHub repos where I've contributed code.

## More About Me :camping:
- Head over to the [Background Tab](https://davejacobson12.github.io/background/) for more information on my professional / academic background and to learn more about me!
