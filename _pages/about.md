- Visualization: Rshiny, Rmarkdown, PowerBI, Tableau
- Code Management: Git, Singularity, Docker, Conda
- Bioinformatics: SNP Calling, Genome Reconstruction / Assembly, Functional Annotation, Molecular Epidemiology, Microbiome Analysis (16S rRNA, Metagenomics)
- Analytics: Clustering, Machine Learning, Performance Optimization, Parametric / Non-Parametric Stats

## Projects :books:
- Jump to the [Projects tab](https://davejacobson12.github.io/projects/) for analyses, workflows, and reports. 
  - Note the reports are facsimiles using dummy data instead of real outbreak clusters and IDs.

## Code Availability :floppy_disk:
- My [GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/davejacobson12/Portfolio) hosts code used for the  Projects tab.
- The [Repositories tab](https://davejacobson12.github.io/repositories/) has links to GitHub repos where I've contributed code.
