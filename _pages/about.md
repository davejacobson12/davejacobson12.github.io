At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, my focus is on harnessing bioinformatics to enhance molecular surveillance of parasitic diseases. We've developed analytical methods that illuminate the genetic diversity of malaria, aiding public health strategies. Our team has optimized bioinformatic workflows, significantly improving genetic clustering accuracy and reducing turnaround times.

My role involves translating complex molecular surveillance results into clear, actionable takeaways for a diverse set of stakeholders, from epidemiologists to federal leadership. With competencies in statistical data analysis, Microsoft Power BI, and containerization, I contribute to high-impact projects that integrate laboratory and bioinformatic data, driving strategic decisions in public health.
