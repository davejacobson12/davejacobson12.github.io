### Backround and Interests

At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), I led efforts in molecular surveillance of parasitic diseases, developing advanced analytical methods that reveal the genetic diversity of pathogens like Plasmodium. These insights directly informed outbreak response strategies and national surveillance efforts. By optimizing and containerizing bioinformatic workflows, our team has significantly improved the accuracy of genetic clustering and reduced turnaround times for critical public health investigations.

A core part of my role was translating complex molecular data into clear, actionable insights for a wide audience—including epidemiologists, laboratory scientists, and federal decision-makers. I bring a strong foundation in data science and analytics, with experience in statistical modeling, Power BI dashboarding, and integrating multi-source data in high-performance computing environments. My tools of choice include Python, R, Nextflow, Bash, Singularity, Docker, Git, and cloud/HPC platforms.

My background also includes a PhD in Anthropology, where I specialized in microbiome bioinformatics. I developed scalable workflows for analyzing shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA data, applying these tools to projects ranging from ovarian cancer and gut microbiome resilience to ancient DNA. I collaborated with clinicians, researchers, and international partners to generate rigorous, peer-reviewed publications that have expanded our understanding of microbial diversity across populations and contexts.

Whether through genomic surveillance, microbial ecology, or applied data analytics, I am dedicated to using computational tools to solve real-world problems. This portfolio highlights some of the impactful projects I’ve worked on and the skills I bring to the intersection of bioinformatics, data science, and public health.
