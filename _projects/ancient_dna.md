### Background
Ancient human microbiomes present the opportunity to more fully understanding human health and lifestyle in the past. As the ancient DNA field developed and adapted to studying ancient human microbiomes, the field rightfully focused on validating methods that could faithfully reconstruct the taxonomic composition of these complex microbial communities. My research came at a time when the data generated from dental calculus, and some coprolites, was of sufficient quality that we could begin to ask more complex questions about ancient human microbiomes. I was interested in reconstructing ecological networks, estimating ecological resilience, and identifying keystone taxa in ancient human microbiomes to understand human lifestyles in the past. 

### Analyses
Ecological networks show a picture of which taxa are interacting with each other across all samples in a dataset, allowing us to generalize taxonomic relationships and network properties for a given set of samples. We constructed networks using sparse correlation coefficient software (sparCC) and keystone taxa were identified by using statistical techniques (hubscore, pagerank, closeness centrality) that rank the most important members of a network. Ecological resilience was estimated by calculating the diversity of taxa that perform certain key functional roles in the microbial community. Applying these techniques to ancient microbiome data was novel and presented a unique look at how ancient human microbiome communities were structured. 

### Findings
This project demonstrated that using ecological techniques is feasible for ancient human microbiome communities, albeit with high quality samples. The profile identified in ancient dental calculus and coprolies were similar to calculus from contemporary non-industrial populations, and the dental calculus ecology was showed similarities to oral microbiome communities associated with periodontitis. Interestingly, samples from the copper age in Italy had a unique oral microbiome community, which may be linked to continued exposure to copper, which is an antimicrobial agent. 

### My Role
- Analysis: Bioinformatic analysis (QC, functional prediction), statistical analysis (ecological resilience, keystone taxa, networks)
- Publication: Lead author, figure generation
