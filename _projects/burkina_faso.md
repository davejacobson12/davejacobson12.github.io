### Background

Understanding the role of the human microbiome in health and disease requires knowing which microbial taxa are present and what they're doing. High-taxonomic diversity in people living non-industrial lifestyles has often been interpreted as being beneficial, while the lower taxonomic diversity associated with industrial gut microbiomes is often linked with metabolic disorders and poor health outcomes. My work aimed to take our understanding beyond a list of which taxa are present by incorporating ecological frameworks to study the resilience potential of the human gut microbiome. More specifically, I studied the richness and abundance of taxa responsible for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis in gut microbiomes from people living diverse lifestyles throughout the world to estimate functional resilience and uncover if people from industrial backgrounds are more prone to losing SCFA production when their microbiomes are stressed.

### Analyses
I studied shotgun metagenomic data from 12 populations across the world, including data from when I visited Burkina Faso and collaborated with the Centre Murez Research Institute, and documented the prevelance of taxa involved in SCFA synthesis pathways using the humann2 analysis pipeline. I then estimated the resilience of the microbial communities by calculating phylogenetic diversity and Hill numbers for taxa involved in SCFA synthesis. 

### Findings 
Overall, non-industrial gut microbiomes had greater richness and evenness for production of SCFAs. The increased number of taxa producing SCFAs, and their generally even relative abundance in the microbial community, suggests that non-industrial gut microbiomes are more resilient for SCFA production. However, the picture is clouded by ascertainment bias that meant detecting the taxa involved in SCFA production was more likely in industrial microbiomes than non-industrial microbiomes. This indicates that the levels of resilience in non-industrial gut microbiomes is underestimated.

### My Role
- Sample Collection: labeling sample collection tubes, shipping collection materials internationally
- Sample Processing: DNA extraction (Travelled to Burkina Faso to train collaborators), qPCR, PCR (shotgun metagenomics), library preparation
- Analysis: Bioinformatic analysis (QC, genome assembly, functional prediction), statistical analysis (ecological resilience, taxonomic abundance)
- Publication: Lead author, figure generation
