### Background 
The United States sees about 1,000 to 2,000 cases of *P. falciparum* malaria in travelers returning from malaria endemic countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 2014, CDC has requested that State Public Health Labs submit blood samples from these cases in order for CDC to identify antimalarial drug resistance across 6 genes. When combined with antimalarial drug efficacy studies performed in endemic regions, information on antimalarial drug resistance in returning travelers can inform guidance on which antimalarial prophylaxis are most likely to be effective and thus be recommended to be prospective travelers. While informative, the sequencing data was generated from 6 short amplicons (1 for each gene) and thus limits the data that can be gleaned from these samples.

My team's goal was to transition CDC from using a amplicon-based approach to a whole-genome based approach (i.e., selective whole-genome amplificatio, or sWGA) for *P. falciparum* surveillance. The sWGA approach allows CDC to capture the full length of the original 6 genes, plus potential novel genes/mechanisms of antimalarial resistance, as well as facilitating genome-wide comparisons that can inform public health researchs on *P. falciparum* genomic characteristics that are hidden when only using amplicon data.

### Analysis

### Findings

### My Role
- Study Design: Development of geographic prediction panels, identify genes for novel antimalarial resistance analysis
- Analysis: Bioinformatic analysis (QC, mapping, SNP calling, indel analysis), statistical analysis (clustering, geographic prediction, complexity of infection, drug resistance interpretation)
- Communication: Presentations to leadership, CDC epidemiologists, State Public Health Department epidemiologists
- Publications: supporting author, figure generation, manuscript draft
