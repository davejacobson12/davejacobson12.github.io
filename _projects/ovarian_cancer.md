### Background

Ovarian cancer 5-year survivability is strongly correlated with how tumors respond after cytoreductive surgery and primary platinum-based chemotherapy: individuals with cancer recurrence within 6 months of treatment cessation have much lower survivability than patients with cancer recurrence that happens after 24 months. Various studies have implicated the human microbiome in tumerigenesis and response to chemotherapeutic agents; our study sought to uncover assocations between gut / vaginal microbiome communities and the length of time between platinum-based chemotherapy and recurrence of ovarian cancer. 

### Analysis

Gut and vaginal microbiome samples were collected by clinicians in the operating room and/or follow-up visits. I generated and analyzed 16S rRNA amplicon data to characterize microbial diversity in these samples, comparing diversity metrics between patients with platinum-free intervals (PFI) of less than 6 months to those with PFI 24+ months and those with benign tumors. I also calculated odds-ratios to determine if any microbial community type was associated with a particular PFI category.

### Findings
Patients with PFI under 6 months were significantly more likely to have vaginl microbiomes dominated by *Escherichia*, which is noteworthy because *Escherichia* is not typically associated with healthy vaginal microbiomes and it has been linked to high inflammation in a number of contexts. Additionally, there was a subset of study patients with lower gut microbiome diversity (also associated with poor health) and this subgroup was primarily made up of patients with PFI < 6 months. Since the study was focused on characterizing the microbial communities, we did not study the mechanisms behind the associations. 


### My Role
- Sample Collection: labeling sample collection tubes, coordinate with clinical research staff to drop-off/pick-up samples, strategize with clinicians for optimal sample collection approach in operating room.
- Sample Processing: DNA extraction, qPCR, PCR (16S rRNA), library preparation, DNA sequencing (Illumina)
- Analysis: Bioinformatic analysis (QC, QIIME for 16S rRNA data), statistical analysis (diversity metrics, taxnomic classification, odds ratios)
- Publication: Lead author, figure generation
